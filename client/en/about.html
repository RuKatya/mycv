            <p>
                All my life I was sure that I want to go into a medical field. I wondered about studying Cardiology,
                Physiotherapy or Nursing. After trying and failing in enrolling into those spheres, I decided to study
                Medical Systems Management. It did not take long to understand that the medical sphere was much less
                suitable for me than I anticipated and instead the Programing aspect of my courses were much
                interesting. In
                some ways I failed upwards, in the sense of my failings made me understand where my passion lays. Even
                though it was clear I wouldn't work in the medical sphere after graduating, I kept on studying until I
                finished my B.A.
