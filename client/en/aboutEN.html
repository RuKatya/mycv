            <p class="about__content--paragOne">
                All my life I was confident that I wanted to work in a medical field. I thought about studying
                physiotherapy or nursing. I decided to study medical systems management and afterwards continue on to
                nursing. It took time to understand that taking care of patients is too much responsibility for me,
                whilst studying for my degree programing courses made much more sense and aroused my interest. Even
                though it was clear I wouldn't work in the medical sphere after graduating, I kept on studying until I
                finished my BA in order to have a profession in the future.

            <p class="about__content--paragTwo">
                After graduating, I undertook several courses from YouTube and paid courses in C, Java. While exploring
                different languages, I felt empowered, observing the code turning from nothing to something beneficial.
                It got me excited. Subsequently, Javascript encouraged me to become a web developer. A combination of
                CSS, HTML and more can provide a seamless experience to a user through the browser. Finally, I decided
                to turn it into a career; thatâ€™s why you are reading my CV.
