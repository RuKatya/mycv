            <p class="about__content--paragOne">
                All my life I was sure that I want to work in a medical field. I wondered about studying Physiotherapy
                or Nursing. I decided to study Medical Systems Management and afterwards continue to nursing. It took
                time to understand that taking care for patient is too much responsibility for me. While learning for my
                degree programing courses made much more sense and rose my interest. Even though it was clear I wouldn't
                work in the medical sphere after graduating, I kept on studying until I finished my B.A. to have a
                profession.

                After graduating I took several courses from YouTube & paid courses in C, Java. While exploring
                different languages I felt empowered, observing the code turning from nothing to something beneficial.
                It got me excited. However, Javascript encouraged me to become a web developer. Combination of CSS, HTML
                and more can provide seamless experience to user through the browser. Finaly I decided to turn it into a
                career, thatâ€™s why you read my C.V.
